# 🦠 HyperVirus

**Where digital organisms evolve, mutate, and build — together.**

Welcome to the official open-source home of **HyperVirus** — a story-rich, weirdly fun Web3 universe powered by NFTs, interactive dApps, and a vibrant community-first philosophy.

We believe in **open collaboration**, **radical transparency**, and the creative chaos of a code-infected world. Every line of code here is a building block for something bigger.

## 🧬 What Is HyperVirus?

HyperVirus is a living, evolving digital world where:
- NFTs are **interactive smart portals**, not just static assets.
- Players shape the story through missions, mutations, and exploration.
- Every tool, feature, and contract is **open-source** for the community.
- Royalties and rewards loop back to the holders.
- All dApps, smart contracts, and ecosystem tools are **free to build on**.

We're not just building a project — we're building an open movement.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

This GitHub organization contains multiple repositories, including:

- NFT contracts, mission systems, royalty logic, and reward distributions.
- React-based interfaces and interactive UI/UX for all portals.
- API logic, snapshot systems, leaderboard mechanics.
- Scripts, utilities, and dev tools to help expand the ecosystem.
- Select visual components and resources for community use.

Each repo includes its own `README.md` with usage, installation, and contribution instructions.
